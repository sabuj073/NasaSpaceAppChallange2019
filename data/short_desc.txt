Our project name is RETEA - Real Time Evaluation of Asteroid

We have used machine learning technique(Deep Neural Network) to classify near earth objects whether they are hazardous to earth or not and predict impact if any asteroid hit the earth.
NEO that can hit earth are visualised in 3d in our web app.
Project includes the following features - 
 1 . Hazardous asteroid nformation from NASA directory(using API) in real time.
 2 . Close approach date and time.
 3 . Asteroid orbit visualisation in 3d
 4 . Asteroid impact information
